## Python version of:

## ****************************************************************************
## ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK SIMULATOR: VERSION 1.1  J.F.Kurose
##
## Network properties/assumptions:
##   - one-way network delay averages 5.0 time units (longer if there
##     are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
##   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
##     or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
##   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
##     (although some can be lost).

## University of Utah
## March 2022
##
## Run `python3 <thisfile.py> -h` in a terminal window to see the various
## parameters that you can set for a run of this simulator.
##
## This program defines a variable `TRACE` that you can use to conditionally
## print messages from your SndTransport and RcvTransport methods.  For example:
##
##   if TRACE>0:
##       print('A very important event just happened!')
##
## The value of `TRACE` is set by the `-v` command line option.  The default
## value of `TRACE` is 0 (meaning "no tracing").

## ***************** TASKS: COMPLETE THE CODE BELOW **************************
##
## The code blocks you have to implement are marked as TODO
##
## NOTICE: When you implement these methods, use instance variables only!
## I.e., variables that you access through `self' like `self.x`.  Do NOT use
## global variables (a.k.a. module-scoped variables) or class variables.
##
## The reason for this restriction is the autograder, which may run several
## simulations within a single Python process.  For each simulation, the
## autograder will create a new instance of SndTransport and a new instance of
## RcvTransport.  If you use global variables and/or class variables in your
## implmentations of SndTransport and RcvTransport, then your code may not work properly
## when run by the autograder, and you may LOSE POINTS!

## ********************** STUDENT-CALLABLE FUNCTIONS **************************
##
## NOTICE: These are functions that should be called from your SndTransport and
## RcvTransport methods.
##
## The first argument to each of these student-callable functions is the object
## that is invoking the function.  Within an SndTransport or RcvTransport method, that
## object is available as `self`.  For example, to start a timer in one of your
## entity methods, you would do something like:
##
##   start_timer(self, 10.0) # Start a timer that will go off in 10 time units.
##
## Or to send a packet to layer3, you would do something like:
##
##   to_layer3(self, Pkt(...)) # Construct a Pkt and send it to layer3.
##
